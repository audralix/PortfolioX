                The major factor is to borrow the equipment from the inventory
                room. The minor actions under each major function were evaluated
                to implement on the application.

                For being considered the product as a kit, choosing multiple
                items are likely to behave as a kit (pack). So for that reason,
                that calendar demonstrates available dates for the kit (pack)
                regardless of each item.

                The users found the application easy to use. They generally did

                  There are two main headers of products based on the affinity
                  diagram. Those tables ' names are categories and
                  subcategories. There is another table having data for each
                  product, which name is the items table.

                  For a demonstration of logic on the table, colour
                  categorisation was used below images. Every product has
                  categoryid and subcategory_id number, which defines what item
                  connects what categories and subcategories. For instance, 3 of
                  categoryid of item on table is related to the lenses of the
                  categories table, similarly to 2 is connected to cameras on
                  the categories table. The same method is applied to the
                  connection between items and the subcategories table.

                  As for creating a kit that means combined items (products),the
                  kitid column is assigned to define what items can be combined
                  on the items table. The method of it is that if each item has
                  the same kitid number, they can be combined with each other.
                  For example, the items that have 17 number in the kitid column
                  mean that they are a kit, and the user can borrow them as a
                  kit instead of choosing separately while using Media Equip.

                  When the user submits what items (products) were borrowed, the

                <p>
                  One of the important parts of this table is that it works
                  based on ItemId of the borrowed items, which means that the
                  data of the user iterates according to how many items were

                  The calendar allows the users to choose a date range on which
                  items (products) that the user wanted to borrow were available
                  together, which means that the date range of items that had
                  been borrowed before is blocked on the calendar. That is to
                  say, those days overlap on the calendar, and this case leads
                  the user to choose when all selected items were available
                  together on the calendar.

                  The APK was sent to users to test the application, and it was
                  observed while they were using the application. The valuable

                  Half of the users struggled to operate the calendar.
                  Unfortunately, Ionic Framework's calendar was used, and there
                  was no date range picker calendar template on Ionic. That was
                  the only calendar framework that led the users to choose
                  multiple days, which was the component constraint I came
                  across.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  By reconsidering how to make the calendar more understandable
                  for the users, some changes were taken into account for
                  revision on the calendar.
